            <p>If you are looking for an array of bright colors to spark up your space, or looking for a joyful build, the LEGO wildflower set is for you! This LEGO set from the botanical collection includes a variety of complementary species from all over the world. The wildflowers create a soothing beauty celebrating the biodiversity of our planet. 
            The wildflower set is very fun to build because since you are putting together various flowers, you do not get tired by working on the same thing for so long. Also, it is very satisfying to see the entire set come together at the end. Each flower is handled individually so you are able to arrange them in whatever way you like. You can also mix in flowers from other LEGO botanical sets. Even the small flower sets can be mixed into a larger one like this. </p>

            <p>What I find unique about this set is the variety of pieces used to make these flowers come to life. LEGO pieces can come in any color and can be used in so many different ways. When I was building this set, I became excited over the unique pieces being used. For example, the petals on the yellow and purple gerbera daisies are yellow and purple oar pieces. The receptacles are green barrels, and the brown centers are samurai hats. On the larkspur flower, green sausage pieces are used to connect the buds to the stem and solid blue LEGO heads are used for unbloomed buds. The purple lupin flower petals are all pirate hat pieces that have been around since 1989. At first glance you would not notice these pieces being used, but if you take a closer look it is so much fun to see the creativity of this set. </p>

            <p> The only thing I have to say about criticizing this set is you kind of have to have the right vase/vessel to display the set. A vase with a narrow mouth is great because your flowers will set in place better (stay still and not move with gravity). The lupin flowers are top-heavy so a narrow mouth is more helpful for the flower to stand more upwards and not bend.</p>
