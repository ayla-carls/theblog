        For a solid one build set, the Lego orchid is a stunning piece to elevate any space. I truly admire this set for its accurate depiction of an orchid. There is so much beauty in this set that sets the bar high for other Lego botanical sets.
	    The designer of the Lego orchid, Michael Psiaki, said creating the geometry of the pot was one of his favorite challenges when designing this set. The blue of the pot and the triangular ridges add such a stunning complementary look to the set. In general, the color palette of the orchid is harmonious. When I look at the orchid I’ve built I feel a sense of calmness and security. Even while building the orchid set, I had a very relaxing time constructing it.
	    A fun thing about the orchid is you can rearrange the stems to different lengths, rotate the roots, leaves, and blooms to any way you like. So if you become bored of one look, you can switch it up and keep it fresh. Plus, this is so much easier than taking care of a real orchid!
	    Like in every Lego set, we get to build with a variety of unique Lego pieces. The orchid features some of the most fun unique pieces I’ve seen from Lego. The orchid set has six full blooms and two smaller buds. The anther cap of the orchid blooms are magenta frogs. This little detail is so cute for the set. You don’t even notice they are frogs until you look at it hard enough. The two small buds are Demogorgon (for the hit Netflix show Stranger Things) Lego heads. They are just painted to look like little orchid buds. When I saw these pieces I was blown away by their illusion to create the little orchid buds. 
	    Another feature I love about this Lego set is how the orchid is potted in the mulch. Orchids are potted with mulch to allow air flow and drainage for the roots. The mulch pieces in this set are free standing (they are not attached to anything, you just place them in the pot) to give that real life look. The mulch pieces are claw elements from the Lego NEXO KNIGHTS sets. 
	    The one build aspect of this set makes it so the set can be transferred easily and fits into any space with formal ease. If you’re looking for a relaxing build and outcome, the Lego orchid set is the perfect build for you.
